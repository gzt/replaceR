/* 
   A C program meant to be used with the Mersenne Twister code in order to 
   replace reliance on the R standalone library if it is only being used
   to generate from a uniform distribution. It will not be exactly the same
   for the same seeds as the R library, however, it will be reproducible. 

   Run set_seed() with two integers as before, then use runif() as before.
